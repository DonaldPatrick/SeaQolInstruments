# Seattle Quality of Life Group (SeaQoL) Archive

## 1 About SeaQoL  
For more than three decades the Seattle Quality of Life Group in the UW School of Public Health advanced the science—and everyday practice—of measuring how people feel and function while living with health conditions, disabilities, or social stigma. SeaQoL’s multidisciplinary team created rigorously validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments, consulted for regulators and sponsors, and trained the next generation of outcomes scientists. As the program sunsets in 2025, we are releasing all instruments, scoring code, and manuals under an open license so the work can continue to benefit clinicians, researchers, and—most importantly—patients.
